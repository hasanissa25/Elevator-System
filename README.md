## Breakdown of Responsibilities

### Iteration 0 & 1
- Milestone descrption : "For this iteration, focus on a state machine for controlling the elevator and testing its operation.  Each elevator needs an arrival sensor.  You can either do one sensor per elevator per floor, or one sensor per elevator that returns a floor value.  I'll leave that up to you, though the cheapskate in me would lead me to use one sensor per elevator to save on sensors and wires.  Don't forget the elevator controller has to open and close the doors (and even turn lights on and off as necessary).  It's also up to you if the scheduler is a state machine or not (though it's likely easier as an extended state machine, where state is encoded in more than one instance variable) in the grand scheme of things).  The fun part comes later in the project where information has to be shared among elevators to optimize their scheduling.  Don't be surprised if you have to move stuff around (refactor).  It's all part of the grand scheme of things"
